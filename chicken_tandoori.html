        <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken</li>
                <li>Lemon Juice</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>Curd</li>
                <li>Ginger Garlic Paste</li>
                <li>Kashmiri Chilli Powder</li>
                <li>Garam Masala</li>
                <li>Black Pepper</li>
                <li>Ground Cumin</li>
                <li>Ground Coriander</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
                <li>Kasthuri Methi</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Procedure :</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Use a sharp knife to make 3-4 deep slits on each piece of chicken (thighs, drumsticks, etc.).</li>
                <li>Rub the chicken thoroughly with lemon juice and salt. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. This step helps the spices penetrate better.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, all the ground spices (Kashmiri chili, garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric), and a dash of oil.</li>
                <li>Add the prepped chicken to the bowl. Use your hands to massage the marinade deep into the slits and crevices.</li>
                <li>over the bowl and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours, or ideally, overnight (8-12 hours), for maximum flavor and tenderness.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to a high temperature (around 400 deg F / 200 deg C), or preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Place the chicken on a rack over a baking tray (or directly on the grill grates). Bake or grill until the chicken is cooked through and the edges are nicely charred.</li>
                <li>In the last 5 minutes of cooking, brush the chicken with a little melted butter or ghee.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat, let it rest briefly, and serve immediately with fresh lemon wedges and mint raita.</li>
