    <h1>How to prepare PAROTTA</h1>
    <img src="recipe images/parotta.jpg"><br>
    <p>There are few culinary creations that capture the heart and palate quite like the Parotta, a layered flatbread that is an absolute masterpiece of texture and taste. Originating in the Indian subcontinent, this is not just bread; it's an ephemeral cloud of dough, crisp on the outside and wonderfully soft, flaky, and tender within. Making a perfect parotta is a meditation in motion, where simple ingredients of flour, water, and oil are transformed through skillful kneading and the rhythmic slapping and folding technique into hundreds of delicate, paper-thin layers. To learn this recipe is to unlock the secret to an astounding and beautiful bread that elevates any meal it accompanies, especially when paired with a rich, aromatic curry that seeps into its buttery folds.</p><br>
        <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Water or Milk</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Oil or Ghee</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure :</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour (Maida/All-Purpose Flour), salt, and sugar.</li>
            <li>Slowly add warm water or milk (or the water/milk/egg mixture) and begin to knead. The dough should be soft, smooth, and very pliable—softer than chapati dough.</li>
            <li>Coat the dough generously with oil. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or a lid and let it rest for a minimum of 2 hours (3-4 hours or more is even better).</li>
            <li>After resting, gently punch the dough down. Divide it into equal, medium-sized balls (known as beeda).</li>
            <li>Place the dough balls in a wide container and coat them completely with a generous amount of oil.</li>
            <li>Take one oiled ball and place it on a clean, oiled kitchen counter or work surface. Do not use dry flour.</li>
            <li>Once thinly stretched, lift one end of the sheet and begin folding it like an accordion or a paper fan, creating long, thin pleats.</li>
            <li>Hold the pleated strip vertically. Start rolling it tightly into a spiral shape (like a coiled rope) and tuck the end underneath the coil.</li>
            <li>Place the coiled spirals back into the oiled container and let them rest for a final 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take one spiral coil and gently flatten it with your palm and fingers into a 4-6 inch circle. Avoid using a rolling pin with too much pressure to keep the layers intact.</li>
            <li>Heat a tawa (griddle) over medium-high heat. Place the flattened parotta on the tawa. Cook for about a minute until tiny bubbles appear.</li>
            <li>Flip the parotta, apply a teaspoon of oil or ghee around the edges and on top. Flip again and press gently with a spatula until both sides are golden brown and crisp.</li>
            <li>mmediately after taking the hot parotta off the tawa, place it on a board or counter. Gently "crush" or "slap" the hot parotta together between your palms.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process for the remaining dough! Serve hot with your favorite curry (like Salna, Kurma, or Chicken/Mutton Curry).</li>
